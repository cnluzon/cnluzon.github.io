## About me

Hi there! I am Carmen Navarro Luzón. I am currently working as a Researcher at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence department](http://decsai.ugr.es) at the [University of Granada](http://www.ugr.es), Spain. I obtained my PhD on Information and Communication Technologies here. However, I have been working in several places. 

I started obtaining a B. Sc. in Computer Science at the [University of Granada](http://www.ugr.es). During this time, I spent one year abroad studying in the United States, at the [University of North Carolina at Greensboro](http://www.uncg.edu), where I also worked as a part-time Research Assistant for Dr. Nancy Green. Later on, I spent an Erasmus year in Germany, wher e I wrote my final project at [Koblenz-Landau University](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de). There, I had the exciting opportunity to participate in the [RoboCup@home](http://www.robocup.org/domains/3) Robotics competition both at the German Open and World Cup 2011 with the Koblenz University Homer team. 

I obtained a M. Sc. in Soft Computing and Intelligence Systems at the University of Granada while working as a Predoctoral Researcher at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence department. In 2013 I obtained a FPU grant from the [Spanish Ministry of Education](https://www.mecd.gob.es), and I started my PhD in the same department, working on **Bioinformatics**. During my PhD years, I have also worked in other labs as a visiting researcher. First, at the [Cambridge Systems Biology Centre & Department of Genetics](https://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge, United Kingdom](http://www.cam.ac.uk/), at Dr. Boris Adryan's research group. In 2015 I spent five months at the [Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain](http://www.crg.eu), under the guidance of Dr. Rory Johnson and Dr. Roderic Guigó. 

## Research interests and projects

I am a **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology researcher with strong background on Computer Science**. I have always been interested both in Programming and Artificial Intelligence. During my PhD, my research interests moved towards Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, where I discovered a fascinating field on which apply and broaden my Computer Science skills. As a researcher in such an interdisciplinary field, my interests span areas of knowledge such as Software Development, Machine Learning, Statistics, Genomics or Molecular Biology. 

I have worked on several Bioinformatics projects, including motif-based computational approaches to find regulatory elements and modules ([CisMiner](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25268582), [DiGSNP](http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/556)), prioritization methodologies on heterogeneous networks applied to biological entities ([ProphTools](http://github.com/cnluzon/prophtools), [DrugNet](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365714001444)), and the study of long non-coding RNAs. 

Here, at my Github account, you can download or contribute to the source code for our latest project, [ProphTools](http://github.com/cnluzon/prophtools), a general method for propritization on heterogeneous networks, available under GPLv3.0+ license.
