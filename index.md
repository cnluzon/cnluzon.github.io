## About me

Hi there! I am Carmen Navarro Luzón. I am currently a Bioinformatics postdoctoral researcher at [Dr. Simon Elsässer's lab](https://elsaesserlab.wordpress.com/) at [Science for Life Laboratory](https://www.scilifelab.se/about-us/), Stockholm, since 2018. 

I obtained my PhD on Information and Communication Technologies at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence department](http://decsai.ugr.es) at the [University of Granada](http://www.ugr.es), Spain. During my PhD years, I have also worked in other labs as a visiting researcher. First, at the [Cambridge Systems Biology Centre & Department of Genetics](https://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge, United Kingdom](http://www.cam.ac.uk/), at Dr. Boris Adryan's research group. In 2015 I spent five months at the [Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain](http://www.crg.eu), under the guidance of Dr. Rory Johnson and Dr. Roderic Guigó. 

## Research interests and projects

I am a Bioinformatics and Computational Biology researcher with background on Computer Science and Engineering. I have always been interested both in Programming and Artificial Intelligence. During my PhD, my research interests moved towards Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, where I discovered a fascinating field on which I could apply and broaden my Computer Science skills. As a researcher in such an interdisciplinary field, my interests span areas of knowledge such as Software Development, Machine Learning, Statistics, Genomics or Molecular Biology. 

I have worked on several Bioinformatics projects, including motif-based computational approaches to find regulatory elements and modules ([CisMiner](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25268582), [DiGSNP](http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/556)), prioritization methodologies on heterogeneous networks applied to biological entities ([ProphTools](http://github.com/cnluzon/prophtools), [DrugNet](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365714001444)), and the study of long non-coding RNAs. 

Here, at my GitHub account, you can download or contribute to the source code for our latest project, [ProphTools](http://github.com/cnluzon/prophtools), a general method for prioritization on heterogeneous networks, available under GPLv3.0+ license.
