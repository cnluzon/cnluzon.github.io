## About me

Hi there! I am Carmen Navarro Luzón. I am currently a Bioinformatics postdoctoral researcher at [Dr. Simon Elsässer's lab](https://elsaesserlab.wordpress.com/) at [Science for Life Laboratory](https://www.scilifelab.se/about-us/), Stockholm, since 2018. 

I obtained my PhD at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence department](http://decsai.ugr.es) at the [University of Granada](http://www.ugr.es), Spain. During my PhD years, I also worked in other labs as a visiting researcher. First, at the [Cambridge Systems Biology Centre & Department of Genetics](https://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge, United Kingdom](http://www.cam.ac.uk/), and later on at the [Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain](http://www.crg.eu).

## Research interests and projects

I am a Computational Biology researcher with a background in Computer Science and Engineering. I have always been interested both in Programming and Artificial Intelligence. During my PhD, my research interests shifted towards Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, where I discovered a fascinating field on which I could apply and broaden my Computer Science skills. As a researcher in such an interdisciplinary field, my interests span areas of knowledge such as Software Development, Machine Learning, Statistics, Genomics or Molecular Biology. I am also very interested in the process of research in itself. I believe that making data analysis processes reproducible and transparent makes our results more reliable and allows us to benefit from the help of our peers. In this sense, I am always learning about Reproducible Science and trying to translate what I learn about good software development practices to my own research.

During my PhD, I worked on several Bioinformatics projects, including motif-based computational approaches to find regulatory elements and modules ([CisMiner](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25268582), [DiGSNP](http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/556)), prioritization methodologies on heterogeneous networks applied to biological entities ([ProphTools](http://github.com/cnluzon/prophtools), [DrugNet](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365714001444)), and the study of long non-coding RNAs.

Nowadays I work analysing genomics data coming from experiments like ChIP-seq (especially MINUTE-ChIP, a quantitative multiplexed method that leads to very [interesting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719310940?via%3Dihub) [findings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00916-w)), RNA-seq, CUT&Tag. In parallel to this, I also develop tools and workflows to process and visualize NGS data. As an example, you can have a look at [minute](https://github.com/elsasserlab/minute), a Snakemake workflow to process sequencing data from MINUTE-ChIP, and [wigglescout](https://github.com/cnluzon/wigglescout), an R library to facilitate bigWig tracks visualization based on rtracklayer.
